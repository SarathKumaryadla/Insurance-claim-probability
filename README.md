# Predictive Modeling for Insurance Claim Probability

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the probability of insurance claims based on comprehensive car policy features and safety ratings.

## Objectives
- Understand factors influencing claim frequency and severity.
- Help insurance companies assess risk and set appropriate premiums.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on car policies and safety ratings, including features such as policy tenure, age of car, age of policyholder, area cluster, and more.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Standardizing numerical features.
- Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- KNN
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

## Results
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC for each model.
- Best model: XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a predictive model with high precision and recall, providing valuable insights for insurance companies to assess risk and determine premiums.
